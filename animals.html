        <h2>Tigers</h2>
        <h3>Tigers are one of the biggest cats in the world. They mostly hunt at night Tigers ambush their prey from the behind and pounce on their food when it least expects it. Tigers have 6 times better night vision than humans. This is probably a reason why tigers hunt at night. Tigers commonly haev an orange coat wwith black stripes, but there are white tigers too. They aren't as common as orange tigers though. Sadly, because of a tiger's beautiful fur, they are getting hunted. 
        </h3>
        <h2>Wolves</h2>
        <h3>Wolves usually travel in packs. They do this because each wolf can look out for each other. Plus, they don't do well alone. If a pup is born then every wolf in the pack takes care of it. Wolves live in forests, deserts, and even very cold climates like tundras. Dogs have descended from wolves and can be proven by the DNA and nature. </h3>
        <h2>Dolphins</h2>
        <h3>Dolphins are mammals like us and even if they live in water, they need air to breathe. So they need to come to the surface like whales. Dolphins live in almost every sea and ocean. Dolphins are known for their intelligence</h3>
        <h2>Horses</h2>
        <h3>Horses are domestic creatures that are tamed mostly by horse riders. Most wild horses travel and live in herds with their friends and family. Horses have better sense of smell and sound. When they hear something, their ears turn towards the direction.</h3>
        <h2>Elephants</h2>
        <h3>Elephants can be found in savvanahs, woodlands, forests, and other areas that are similiar. Their life span is from 60 to 80 years. Elephants can remember things clearly even when it is about 10 years ago. They could recognize other herds that they haven't seen in a long time. </h3>
